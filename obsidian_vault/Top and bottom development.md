You mav divide development strategies into two categories:
1. Development of high level pieces of the application (top development)
2. Development of low level, fundamental pieces of the application (bottom development)

In top development the first thing you consider is what's going to happen when program starts: 
* what functions will it need to call
* what entities will be needed to start doing the thing
* etc
Top development is not concerned about what happens beneath, but rather about overall picture and usually does not care what exactly they do and produce.

Bottom development on the other hand starts from fundamental pieces that will be needed for the problem, building up from that.
Bottom development is concerned only about pieces beneath and usually expects full control over them.

The actual reality is a mix of both on different levels.
The important thing is what makes more sense for a particular type of development.
